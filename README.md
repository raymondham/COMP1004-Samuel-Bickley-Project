# COMP1004-Samuel-Bickley-Project
Project Name: CloudVault - A Personal Cloud File Manager

Stand up meeting leader = 


Project Vision 

CloudVault keeps a log and tracks personal files uplouded via a web-based SPA, immitating a 'cloud' software and organizes these files by categories and tags whilsts tracking last synced/upload times. Cloud storage is not needed for this project,  just JSON + local storage is necessary as this will produce a backend and provide interactive UI features.


Project Scope (250 words) 

What problem are you solving with CloudBox?
Who is your target user (students, professionals, general public)?
Why would they use your application instead of existing solutions?
What are the must-have features for version 1? (e.g., uploading files, viewing files, saving JSON)
Are there any optional features you want to include if you have time? (e.g., tagging, filtering, categories)
Will your app visualize data (like showing last synced time, file type counts)?
Which technologies will you use? (HTML, CSS/Bootstrap, JavaScript, Node.js for JSON handling)
How will you store data? (local storage, JSON files)
Will your app be a Single Page Application (SPA)?
How will your project help users manage their time or files more effectively?
What’s the main outcome you want someone to achieve after using it?
What could go wrong technically? (e.g., JSON errors, UI issues)
Are there user experience risks? (e.g., hard to navigate, confusing interface)

WHATS LEFT TO BE DONE 


Nov/Dec
3.
Break your project into sprints, each with achievable goals:

Sprint 1: Set up basic SPA with file list view and upload functionality.

Sprint 2: Add JSON read/write for file metadata.

Sprint 3: Add tags, search, and sort features.

Sprint 4: Add last-synced tracking, optional dashboard, and alerts.

Sprint 5: Polish UI, test for edge cases, write UML diagrams, prepare ePortfolio video.

Create a backlog in a planner (e.g., Microsoft Planner or Trello) to track tasks.

4.
HTML: File upload interface, table/grid for files.

CSS/Bootstrap: Layout, responsive design.

JavaScript:

Read/write JSON to local storage.

Handle file upload, tagging, searching, sorting.

Track time/metadata for each file.

Keep the prototype moderately complex, enough to show progress in your mid-project video.

5.
Start your ePortfolio immediately. Include:

Project Initiation (title, vision, scope, requirements)

Project Plan (sprints/backlog)

Risks & mitigation

Every code iteration → commit to GitHub and include comments.

6.
Prepare a 5-minute video showing:

Project vision & background

Project plan & sprint progress

UML diagrams (start with basic class or flow diagrams)

Working prototype demonstration

Challenges/issues faced

Write a 250-word CPD reflection on how any learning (like tutorials, sessions, or online resources) influenced your project approach.




Jan-April
7.
Finish coding all features.

Produce final UML diagrams.

Write 3,000-word report, including 500-word reflection on challenges.

Make poster summarizing CloudBox.

Prepare for viva: run your SPA, explain code, discuss SDLC.
